/************** License stuff **************/
I have used Apache License v2.0, so the same license probably apply.





/************** About the code **************/
Don't expect great and elegant code.

Everything here was coded in a rush (less than one day for this one too).

It's almost the original source code.
This project used to crawl through directories, find pdf and convert them and save the publications converted in a MySQL database. I have removed all the code related to this.
I have removed all the unuse classes (things I tried).



/************** To come **************/
As for now, I don't plan to improve this project because:
	- I have better projects for now
	- I don't have any use of this for now

If you are interested/need it, contact me, I might change/have changed my mind.
